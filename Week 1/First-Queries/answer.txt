**7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.**
The data are as we expected because intagram and facebook are the most apps rated and probably downloaded 
from apple store.

**8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.**
The to app rated is Plant .vs. Zombie that is a game. I believe that is easier to get the top app rated when you aren't the most downloaded app. Some app in the top 10 have less than 1 thousand downloads.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
Apps with higher download data, difficult will be in the top 10.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?**
The top 3 mean is 4.187. 

select track_name, user_rating, rating_count_tot from data

limit 20;

select track_name, user_rating, rating_count_tot from data
order by rating_count_tot DESC, user_rating DESC
limit 3;


**11. Do people care about the price of an app?**
select track_name, user_rating, rating_count_tot, price from data
order by price DESC;
I'm not sure, because I don't have the number of downloads to compare. But the top 10 most rated apps are'nt free, although they cost less than 10 dollars.
